# FrontEnd Challenge 001

For us, it is not all about the CV, titles and portfolio. The most important for us is to know how you face a concrete challenge and how you approach it. What is your way of thinking, how do you tackle the problem, which tools do you use, ...

In order to understand all this, we would like you to complete the following challenge. This is a simplified case which illustrates the kinds of situations we have to deal with on a daily basis.

There are no time limitations but we suggest you dont spend more then a few hours on it. We are not looking for a bullet-proof solution we just want to see a first prototype/approach

## Challenge Description

### The API

Check out a simplified version of our [Surveys API](http://docs.surveysmock.apiary.io/)

Here you can find examples of how to call each of the methods, for example:

    curl --include  "http://surveysmock.apiary.io/api/surveys/001"
    
_This is an API mockup so the methods will always return in the same way no matter which values you put in the request_

### The functionality workflow

1. The user sees all the available surveys
1. The user clicks on one survey
1. The user can complete the questions of the clicked survey
1. The answers are sent to the backend
1. A message is shown to the User: "Thanks for answering the survey!"
1. The User can go back to point 1.

### Programming Requirements

Everything has to work in the browser without any backend support (other than the API we provide).

Only one _html_ page (use as many JS and CSS files as you want).

You can use any frontend library you like, no limitation on quantity and size.

The solution has to work in Chromes last version, don't worry about the others.

### What we assess

- Legible, understandable and maintenable code
- A wise balance between complexity of the problem and complexity of the solution
